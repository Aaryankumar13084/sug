Okay, I understand. You are feeling dizzy. Feeling dizzy during pregnancy (mujhe chakkar aa rahi hai) is quite common, especially in the first trimester. Here's some information and advice:

**Possible Reasons for Dizziness During Pregnancy:**

*   **Hormonal Changes:** Pregnancy hormones cause blood vessels to dilate, which can lower blood pressure.
*   **Increased Blood Volume:** Your body is producing more blood to support the baby, but it takes time for your body to adjust.
*   **Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia):** If you haven't eaten in a while, your blood sugar might be low.
*   **Dehydration:** Not drinking enough water can lead to dizziness.
*   **Lying Down Flat on Your Back (Later in Pregnancy):** The weight of the uterus can compress a major blood vessel (the vena cava), restricting blood flow to your brain.
*   **Anemia:** Iron deficiency is common during pregnancy and can cause dizziness and fatigue.
*   **Overheating:** Getting too hot can also cause you to feel faint.
*   **Stress or Anxiety:** Feeling stressed or anxious can sometimes trigger dizziness.

**What You Can Do Right Now (Immediate Relief):**

*   **Sit or Lie Down:** Immediately sit or lie down to prevent a fall. If you're lying down, lie on your left side.
*   **Eat Something:** If you think it might be low blood sugar, eat a small snack like a piece of fruit, a few crackers, or a glass of juice.
*   **Drink Water:** Sip on some water to rehydrate.
*   **Take Deep Breaths:** Focus on slow, deep breaths to calm your nervous system.

**Things to Do Regularly to Prevent Dizziness:**

*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
*   **Eat Regular Meals and Snacks:** Avoid going too long without eating. Keep healthy snacks with you.
*   **Rise Slowly:** When getting up from a lying or sitting position, do it slowly to allow your blood pressure to adjust.
*   **Avoid Overheating:** Dress in layers and avoid spending too much time in hot environments.
*   **Avoid Lying Flat on Your Back (After the First Trimester):** When lying down, prop yourself up with pillows or lie on your left side.
*   **Get Enough Rest:** Fatigue can contribute to dizziness.
*   **Manage Stress:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
*   **Wear Loose Clothing:** Tight clothing can restrict blood flow.

**When to Seek Medical Advice:**

While dizziness is often normal during pregnancy, it's important to talk to your doctor or midwife if you experience any of the following:

*   **Severe or Persistent Dizziness:** If the dizziness is very strong or doesn't go away.
*   **Dizziness Accompanied by Other Symptoms:** Such as blurred vision, headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations (rapid heartbeat), vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or loss of consciousness.
*   **Frequent Fainting:** If you are fainting frequently.
*   **Concerns About Anemia:** If you are concerned about iron deficiency.

**Important Questions Your Doctor May Ask:**

Be prepared to tell your doctor:

*   How often you experience dizziness.
*   When it started.
*   What seems to trigger it.
*   What other symptoms you are experiencing.
*   What you have tried to relieve the dizziness.

**In summary, dizziness is common in pregnancy, but it's important to pay attention to your body and seek medical advice if you have any concerns.**
